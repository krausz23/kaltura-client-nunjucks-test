# kaltura-client-nunjucks-test

Test case:
 When using both the nunjucks and kaltura-client modules, the nunjucks functionality crashes with
 the following error message: 'TypeError: this.blocks[name].push is not a function'.
 When the kaltura-client module is not require-ed, the issue is not present.
